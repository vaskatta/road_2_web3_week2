# Road to Web 3 Week 2 Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case, which is to Make NFTs with on-chain metadata, using Hardhat and JavaScript. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

The companion website for the cotnract (which I have deployed on the Goerli testnet is on Replit here: https://buymeacoffeesoliditydefitippingapp.liftingweights.repl.co/
